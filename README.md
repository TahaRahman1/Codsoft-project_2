# Simple Calculator

## Overview
This C++ program is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to input two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /), and then displays the result of the operation.

## Features
- **Arithmetic Operations**: The program supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operations.
- **Input Validation**: Input validation is performed to handle cases such as division by zero and invalid operations.
- **Continuous Execution**: The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

## How to Use
1. **Compile the Program**: Compile the C++ source code (`simple_calculator.cpp`) using a C++ compiler.
    ```
    g++ simple_calculator.cpp -o simple_calculator
    ```
2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled binary to run the simple calculator.
    ```
    ./simple_calculator
    ```
3. **Perform Calculations**: Enter two numbers and choose an operation (+, -, *, /) to perform the calculation. The result will be displayed.
